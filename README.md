Valid-Flow
==========

- the target of this project is to find a valid flow in a flow network with minimum and maximum capacities.
- the implementation uses the Edmond-Karp algorithm
- created for a university project in a course about Algorithms and Datastructures
- to run the project, clone the project to your working directory and copy the Data.txt file into the Debug directory so it can be found by Program.cs. Alternativeley you can provide your own flow network here
- format of the input file:

 Node1 Node2 Min.-Capacity Max.-Capacity
